	<h1>Welcome!</h1>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Hi! My name is Sam Monahan and I am a junior at UW-Madison. I am studying Communication Arts with a certificate in Digital Studies. I was born in Upstate New York, but I've grown up in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Out of all the places I have traveled in the world, there's no place like home and Minnesota persists as one of my favorite places ever! This article from City Pages encapsulates some of the reasons why: <a href="http://www.citypages.com/arts/50-reasons-minnesota-is-the-best-state-in-america-6584126" target="_blank">http://www.citypages.com/arts/50-reasons-minnesota-is-the-best-state-in-america-6584126</a><p>
		<p>As I've mentioned, I love to travel, and what comes with a love for travel is a love for good food! I've had amazing opportunities to travel across the globe, experiencing many different cultures. I believe that one of the most authentic ways to indulge in a foreign culture is through food. This website will offer some insight into the places I've been and the foods I love. </p>

	<h3>How does Minnesota compare to the worldly places I've traveled? There are 3 elements that make MN stand out:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>10,000+ Lakes</li>
			<li>MN State Fair Food</li>
			<li>Unique Skylines / Twin Cities</li>
		</ul>
